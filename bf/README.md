# BLOCKFRONT FILES

Mappings can be found here: https://github.com/forteus19/vbm

Running the `namedJar` task will generate the merged mappings, named jar, and original jar. You will have to extract bflib and rename it yourself.

This commit of Front-Utilities is for blockfront 0.7.1.2b.

### PUT THESE FILES HERE:

* Merged mappings (`{version}-merged.tiny`)
* Named jar (`{version}-named.jar`)
* Original jar (`{version}-original.jar`)
* bflib jar (`bflib-{version}.jar`)
